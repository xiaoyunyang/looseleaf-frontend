LooseLeaf is an information technology platform meant to improve online learning. When you are able to find good things online to learn, you are more effective at learning.

#### The Birth of the idea
I use LooseLeaf to organize my own bookmarks. I used to get really frustrated about not being able to find my bookmarks or the amount of time required to get them organized. The existing bookmarking apps don't provide good solutions and I often couldn't find things. Then I started using evernote for bookmarking because I could easily filter notes based on my own keywords. In evernote, I can give each URL a relevant title and a short blurb about why I bookmarked it underneath. I could also save collections of bookmarks in the right notebook and notes to improve my chances of finding things. That's how I came up with the idea for LooseLeaf. It's basically that, but things will be automated.

##### The problem
Bookmarks are hard to organize and share. A lot of useful content for online learning are tribal knowledge, thus scattered and not very easy to find.

##### Problem solution
Putting the bookmarks collection into a representation (e.g., Heatmap and piechart), you can prescribe ways in which bookmarks are being explored. Moreover, by observing how people interact with the collection system, you can discover new patterns in which people explore data to inform a better DataVis menu system.
