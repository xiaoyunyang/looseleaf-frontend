### Bad English Diary
##### The Gist
The idea of the Bad English Diary is to encourage non-english speakers to learn English by writing a diary entry everyday. The concept of learning English by using English everyday is not hard to grasp. However, what makes the Bad English Diary a powerful learning tool is that the language used in a diary entry corresponds directly a memory and vocabularies and expressions used in the diary correspond to everyday expressions which are particularly useful for basic language skills.
