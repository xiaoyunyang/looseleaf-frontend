### Our mission
Can the internet be a platform for sustainable self learning? That’s the fundamental questions that drives so much of what we do at LooseLeaf. LooseLeaf is a social learning platform for lifelong learners and people looking to enrich and upgrade their lives through knowledge.


##### Overcome information overload as a team
We live in the age of information overload, where organic, high quality learning content is often overshadowed by flashy entertainment and news media. There is overwhelming amount of content created everyday to help you grow as a professional and an intellectual, but how much of it really helps you meet your goals?  How much of it is essential?

We want to give people the power to easily discover, navigate, and filter the world’s information by giving groups of knowledge seekers a platform to work asynchronously, but as a team, to curate essential learning resources based on their shared learning objectives.

##### Social learning is sharing what you know with others
online learning is easier when you have companions and mentors who can give you feedback and encourage you to continue a self-education online. LooseLeaf connects knowledge seekers to passionate subject experts and content creators who love sharing what they do with the world and get feedback.  Knowledge seekers with shared learning and skill-building goals can build learning communities where they can engage in discussions and help each other define better learning goals through collaborative filtering and social bookmarking.

As effective learning necessitates effective information management, LooseLeaf help online learners each assemble a repository of essential content that best suit their unique learning styles based on what the community determined to be most effective at conveying a concept or teaching a skill. Knowing what works and what doesn’t work is a type of tribal knowledge seen in classrooms, which LooseLeaf aims to make easily accessible to every online learner.
