##### NumberShapes
<a href="http://number-shapes.com" target="_blank">NumberShapes</a> is a collection of mobile apps that make numbers come alive through numberical visualizations and interactions. In 2014, I worked on the software development for the first few apps, which are iOS matching games that help young learners with familiarization of addition, subtraction, multiplication and other math facts.

The collection of NumberShapes apps has since grew and one of the apps (NumberShapes Whiteboard) received the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8buAFObSpI" alt="NumberShapes Whiteboard is an award winning app for chilren's technology">Editor's Choice Award from the Children's Technology Review</a>.

While the iOS development has been turned over to my co-founder, Andrew, I still support the development of NumberShape's website, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://number-shapes.com">current official website</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="http://number-shapes.herokuapp.com/#/">prototype website</a> with more features, which is being hosted on heroku. The prototype is created using angular.js, Foundation with SASS, node.js, and express.js.
